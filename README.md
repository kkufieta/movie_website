# Movie Website
Note: Source code to generate the Movie website was provided by Udacity.

## About
The movie website is implemented in Python and shows some of my favorite movies and TV Series.

You can view the website in this [demo](https://kkufieta.github.io/movie_website/).

Alternatively, you can fork or clone the project with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kkufieta/movie_website.git
```

and then create and open the website using Python:

```python
python entertainment_center.py 
```

Note: The application is written in Python 2.7.13.
